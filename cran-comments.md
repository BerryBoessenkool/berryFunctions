## General note
This is a regular package update.
It is the first time I'm using devtools::release along with the comments file Hadley suggests.
If I'm doing anything wrong, I'm terrribly sorry ahead. Just let me know...

## Test environments
* x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit) with 3.3.0 (2016-05-03)
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

One NOTE:
Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION: hydrograph 

This is a valid technical term in hydrology describing the time series of flow in a river

## Downstream dependencies
* extremeStat - everything appears to work just fine
